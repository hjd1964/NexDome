There are two arduino sketches included in this tree, one contains
the sources for the dome rotation contoller, and one contains the
sources for the shutter controller.  The OCS integration of this system is
based on changes to the dome rotation controller which enable it's use
within my OCS (simply place the NexDome.ino file within the OCS folder and
compile.)  If this firmware is placed in it's own directory it will compile
for stand-alone use.

Firmware for these controllers was developed using arduino tools
based on Arduino 1.8.3, and makes extensive use of the AccelStepper
library.

If not already installed, the AccelStepper library is available here:-

http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/

Download the zip version of the library there an import into the libraries
of your Arduino tools installation.

The hardware in use is an Arduino Leonardo clone with an xbee socket
already on the board.  For the OnCue OCS on a Mega2560 you'll need to
wire the xbee into Serial2.  Also, for the OnCue OCS the PC/USB connection
is on Serial1 and will need a USB to TTL Serial cable/adapter which are
readily available.

Refer to the individual firmware files for pin connections.

Refer to Update.txt for detailed instructions on how to update firmware
in the individual controllers.
